# Interview Round 2
This is the questionnaire for the second round of interviews.

## Introduction
The introduction of the prototype to the participant contains a short description of how the input of the generator should look like and how the generator can be executed as well as a short guide on installation.

If the participant has no experience with kedro, the interviewer will explain the folder and file structure as well as kedro-viz.

If the participant has no experience with MLflow, the interviewer will explain the basic functionality using the MLflow UI.

The participant is then able to experiment and play around with different input for the generator and use the resulting ML pipelines for 10 minutes.
