# Interview Round 1
This is the questionnaire for the first round of interviews.

## Demographics
- Current role
- Years of professional experience in ML/MLOps 

## General
- How does an ML Pipeline look to you in general?
- (Show ML workflow graph from Amershi et al.) What challenges in terms of quality do you see here?
- What additional features/tools do you need/want?
- How does a ML-Pipeline depend on the dataset?
- How does a ML-Pipeline depend on the type of ML? (e.g.Supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning)
- How does a ML-Pipeline depend on the type of problem? (e.g. Regression, Classification, Forecasting, Action learning)

## Patterns
- (Show list of ML design patterns)
- Which ML design patterns do you use?

## Use Case 1
- A simple dataset is presented (Supervised Learning, Regression)
- Task: Build an ML pipeline


## Use Case 2
- A simple ML pipeline is presented
- What steps or features are missing?

```Reveal topic```

## Pipeline Generation
- What parts of ML Pipelines can be automatically generated?
- (Show list of ML development quality measures from Serban et al.)
- Of these measures, which can be automatically generated?
- Rank these by importance (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
