## General
Please answer the following questions based on your personal professional experience.

- What general components should most ML pipelines have? (if participant has problems to name components, show frequently used ones compiled from literature)
- What situational components do some ML pipelines have? (if participant has problems to name components, show frequently used ones compiled from literature)
- What are the most important quality requirements for ML pipelines? (if participant has problems to name requirements, show frequently used ones compiled from literature)
- How do components and quality requirements of an ML pipeline depend on ...
