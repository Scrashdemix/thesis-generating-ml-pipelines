# Towards Automatically Generating Context-Specific ML Pipelines
This repository contains all publicly available artifacts related to a case study as part of my master thesis about generating Machine Learning (ML) pipelines depending on the context provided by the user.
As a first step, interviews were conducted to analyze practitioner requirements for ML pipeline steps, pipeline quality, as well as the degree of context-dependent variants.
A prototypical generation approach was created based on these results.
Finally, this approach was evaluated in a second round of interviews, where participants used the prototypical tool support.

## Research Objective
```
Develop a tool-supported approach
For the purpose of generating context-dependent ML pipelines
From the viewpoint of ML practitioners
In the context of different ML project requirements
```

## Research Questions
__RQ 1:__ What is important for effective ML pipelines?

__RQ 1.1:__ Which components are important for effective ML pipelines?

__RQ 1.2:__ Which quality requirements are important for effective ML pipelines?

__RQ 2:__ How much are ML pipeline steps and quality requirements influenced by the project- or user-specific context?

__RQ 3:__ What is a feasible approach to automatically generate context-dependent, high-quality ML pipelines?
