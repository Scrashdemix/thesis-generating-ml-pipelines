# Towards Automatically Generating Context-Specific ML Pipelines
This repository contains all publicly available artifacts related to a case study as part of my master thesis about generating Machine Learning (ML) Pipelines depending on the context provided by the user. For this, interviews shall be conducted to figure out the quantity as well as the type of context needed for generating quality ML Pipelines. In a second round of interviews a prototypical approach shall be evaluated by the participants.

## Research Objective
```
Analyze Quality Requirements of ML Pipelines
For the purpose of knowledge generation
With respect to ML Pipeline Generation
From the viewpoint of data scientists
In the context of MLOps
```

## Research Questions
__RQ 1:__ What are quality requirements of ML Pipelines?

__RQ 2:__ How do ML Pipelines depend on a user-specific context?

__RQ 3:__ How can high-quality ML Pipelines be generated depending on the context?
